# Pallet Rack Steel Beam Damage Detection with Detectron 2

An attempt on using Detectron 2 instead of Matterport's M-RCNN for steel beam damage detection.
 
For detection, [open the damage_detection notebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/koivunen/beamdefectdetect_dt2/blob/main/damage_detection.ipynb?hl=en)

The other notebook was used for training. Model is hosted in seafile.
